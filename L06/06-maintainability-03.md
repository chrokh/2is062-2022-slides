Reusability
===========

"Degree to which an asset can be used in more than one system, or in building other assets"

- High modularity + low reusability?

- Expanding into new verticals
- Doing too much

- Premature abstraction
- cost of developing abstraction now
< PV cost of dev abstraction later * P(abstraction is needed)

- "Stick your head in as few guilliotines as possible".
- Do few things, do them well, make them "fundamental".
- Examples: LINQ, composing contracts
