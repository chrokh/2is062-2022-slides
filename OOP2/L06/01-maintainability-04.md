Analysability
=============

"Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change to one or more of its parts, or to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modified."


- Simple, not small.
- Note code golf.
- Analysable at all levels we are unwilling to "throw out".
- Assume that we will always get it wrong, the first time.
